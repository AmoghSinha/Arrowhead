# Arrowhead
Repository containing the notebook and documentation of my attempt at the task given to join Arrowhead 

The code is available in the notebook. Please note that for some reason, some of the graphs are not being shown if you see them directly in github, you may have to open them in colab or jupyter for that. I believe github is unable to show interactive graphs right now. The documentation is also available in the pdf format.
